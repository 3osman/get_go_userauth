Start
For EU students
You must ask for the E-128 Form in their own country in order to be covered according to the French regulations by the CPAM: Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie. Students must contact the Centre des Relations Internationales from their local CPAM office (either in Paris or in the suburbs).
For Non-EU students
If under the age of 28 must buy the French Student Insurance. This insurance will cover medical expenses up to 70%. You may have the option to buy an additional insurance called a Mutuelle to be covered up to 100% (including hospitalization). Any foreign student- whatever his/her nationality is obliged to buy the student insurance. Students over the age of 28 must buy a different insurance. (www.ameli.fr)
